Exercise Manager is an application developed to help you stay fit at home. This tool gives you access to a variety of
different exercises of your personal preferred intensity. You can also create your own exercises and build your very own
exercise programs. If you choose one of the existing programs, the users preferred intensitylevel determines the
program's duration and intensity.
The application reads input from a Scanner, which makes Exercise Manager very easy to use.
The application will tell the user what input it expects, and will ask the user again if the wrong input is typed in.
